- *Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.*
## Purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) 
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to learning about a data set.The main purpose is to examine and summarizethe data to make sense out of the otherwise overwhelming mass of  information.  Data  exploration  and  visualization  provide  tools  for  ensuring  appropriate  and accurate descriptions of the data. EDA can help a data scientist or data analyst to:
- Determine the quality of data
- Find outliers and other errors or anomalies
- Identify possible analysesï‚·Discover potential patterns/relationships
- Identify influential variables
- Visualizations to derive inferences from data
## Advantages of Exploratory Data Analysis
- It gives us valuable insights about the data.
- It helps in detecting outliers in most effective way.
- Helps   in   answering   questions   about   standard   deviations,   categorical   variables,   and confidence intervals.
- Once  EDA  is  complete  and  insights  are  drawn,  its  features  can  then  be  used  for  more sophisticated data analysisor modeling, including machine learning.
